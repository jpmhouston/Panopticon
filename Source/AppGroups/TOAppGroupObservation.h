/**
 *  A base class for App Group Notification observation objects.
 *
 *  An object of this class is returned from each `TotalObserverAppGroup` `to_observe...` method. This result can be
 *  saved for explcitly calling the `remove` method later (see base class `TOObservation`), but that often isn't
 *  necessary since the `to_stopObserving...` methods can be used instead which look-up the matching observation.
 *
 *  The observation object is passed as a parameter to the observation block, and defines properties for accessing
 *  the name, payload, and a timestamp when the notification was posted.
