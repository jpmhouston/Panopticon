 *  The observation will automatically be stopped when either the receiver or the object is deallocated.
 *
 *  If `object` is the same as the receiver, then instead use `pan_observeOwnChangesToKeyPath:withBlock:`.
 *
 *  @param object  The object to observe.
 *  @param keyPath The key path string to observe on `object`.
 *  @param options The KVO observation options. Default is `0` if parameter is omitted.
 *  @param paused  Observation is created with calls to the block paused, if `YES` then `collated` flag is also initially
 *                 set to `YES`. Default is `NO` if parameter is omitted.
