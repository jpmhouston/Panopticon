 *  A base class for KVO observation objects.

 *  An object of this class is returned from each `PANKeyValue` `pan_observe...` method. This result can be saved
 *  for explcitly calling the `remove` method later (see base class `PANObservation`), but that often isn't necessary
 *  since the `pan_stopObserving...` methods can be used instead which look-up the matching observation.
 *
 *  The observation object is passed as a parameter to the observation block, and defines properties for accessing
 *  the key path, change kind, the change dictionary, or its specific values directly such as old and changed values.
