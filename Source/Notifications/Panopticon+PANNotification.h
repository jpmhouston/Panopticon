 *  The observation will automatically be stopped when either the receiver is deallocated.

 *  @param paused Observation is created with calls to the block paused, if `YES` then `collated` flag is also initially

 *  @param block  The block to call when observation is triggered, is passed the receiver (which can be used in place of
 *                a weakly captured self), and the observation (same as method result).
 *
 *  @return An observation object. You often don't need to keep this result.
