/**
 *  A base class for NSNotification observation objects.
 *
 *  An object of this class is returned from each `TotalObserverNotifications` `to_observe...` method. This result
 *  can be saved for explcitly calling the `remove` method later (see base class `TOObservation`), but that often
 *  isn't necessary since the `to_stopObserving...` methods can be used instead which look-up the matching observation.
 *
 *  The observation object is passed as a parameter to the observation block, and defines properties for accessing
 *  the name, notification object, or its specific values directly, the posted object and user info dictionary.
