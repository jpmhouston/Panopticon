 *
 *  @param control The control to observe.
 *  @param paused  Observation is created with calls to the block paused, if `YES` then `collated` flag is also initially
 *                 set to `YES`. Default is `NO` if parameter is omitted.
 *  @param block   The block to call when observation is triggered, is passed the receiver (which can be used in place of
 *                 a weakly captured self), and the observation (same as method result).
 *
 *  @return An observation object. You often don't need to keep this result.
